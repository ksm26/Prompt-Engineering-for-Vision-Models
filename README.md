🔍 Explore the "Prompt Engineering for Vision Models" course, designed to enhance your understanding of prompt engineering techniques in both text and vision models. This course will empower you to prompt and fine-tune various vision models effectively.

## Course Summary
In this course, you'll delve into the realm of prompt engineering for vision models, exploring techniques to prompt models like Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM), OWL-ViT, and Stable Diffusion 2.0. Here's what you'll learn:

1. 🖼️ **Image Generation**: Prompt vision models with text and adjust hyperparameters to generate images with desired characteristics.
2. 🖌️ **Image Segmentation**: Use positive or negative coordinates, along with bounding box coordinates, to prompt models for precise image segmentation.
3. 🎯 **Object Detection**: Employ natural language prompts to produce bounding boxes, isolating specific objects within images.
4. 🖼️ **In-painting**: Combine object detection, image segmentation, and image generation techniques to replace objects within images with generated content.
5. 🌟 **Personalization with Fine-tuning**: Fine-tune diffusion models to generate custom images based on provided pictures of people or places, using a technique called DreamBooth.
6. 🔄 **Iterating and Experiment Tracking**: Learn how to track experiments effectively using Comet, a library that aids in optimizing visual prompt engineering workflows.
